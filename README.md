A computer science student from Taiwan, learned how to programming since high school. My most familiar languages are JavaScript and Python. Started to play CTF since late 2020, mainly focus on web and crypto challenges, but I can solve some easier pwn and reverse. (CTFTime: [maple3142](https://ctftime.org/user/97745))

I have a blog written in Chinese [here](https://blog.maple3142.net/), it is mostly CTF writeups now.
