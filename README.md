I am a master student in NTU CSIE doing research related to security and cryptography.

My favorite programming languages are JavaScript and Python, and I'm also familiar with Java, C, C++, and PHP. Developed a bunch of ~~semi-abandoned~~ projects here.

Started to play CTF since late 2020, and I'm good at Web and Crypto challenges, and I also know a bit about Pwn and Reverse. I play on teams like ${cystick}, XxTSJxX, and sometimes with Balsn, check out my [CTFTime page](https://ctftime.org/user/97745) for more details.

I also have a blog [here](https://blog.maple3142.net/), it is mostly CTF writeups now and most of them are written in Chinese.
